# Lab Log: combat-trainer

**Goal**: Maximize Attack + Strength + Defence + Hitpoints levels over 5 minutes.

**Strategy**: Kill goblins near Lumbridge while cycling combat styles for balanced XP gain.

---

## Run 001 - (pending)

**Setup**: LUMBRIDGE_SPAWN preset - standard tutorial-complete items (bronze sword, shield, dagger, axe, arrows, etc.)

### Hypotheses
1. The new combat SDK features (`player.combat`, `npc.inCombat`, `combatEvents`) will help us track combat state effectively
2. Cycling combat styles every 3 kills will provide balanced training across Attack/Strength/Defence
3. 45 second stall timeout should accommodate natural combat lulls

### Testing
- `player.combat.inCombat` - does this accurately reflect when we're fighting?
- `npc.targetIndex` - can we detect if an NPC is already fighting someone else?
- `combatEvents` array - is damage_dealt/damage_taken tracked reliably?
- Combat style switching - does `sendSetCombatStyle()` work?

### Results
**Outcome**: TIMEOUT (ran full 5 minutes)
**Final Stats**: Attack 12, Hitpoints 12, Combat Level 7+ (from level 3!)

### Observations

**GOOD NEWS**: Training actually worked great! XP was gained steadily despite our broken combat tracking.

**SDK Issues Found**:

1. **`npc.hp` and `npc.maxHp` always 0** - NPC health tracking isn't populating. All goblins show `HP: 0/0`. This makes it impossible to detect NPC death by health.

2. **`player.combat.inCombat` unreliable** - Our `waitForCombatEnd()` exits immediately with "lost_target" even while combat is ongoing (proven by XP gains in state snapshots).

3. **`npc.inCombat` false positives** - Getting "already in combat" for goblins that we should be able to attack. May need to check if NPC is targeting US specifically vs someone else.

4. **`combatEvents` not visible in state snapshots** - Can't confirm if damage_dealt/damage_taken events are firing. Need to log these explicitly.

### Root Cause
Our `waitForCombatEnd()` checks `player.combat.inCombat` which returns false almost immediately, causing us to think combat ended when it hasn't. Meanwhile the actual combat continues in the background and we gain XP.

### Fix Ideas
1. Don't rely on `player.combat.inCombat` - instead wait for XP gains or NPC disappearance
2. Add timeout-based combat wait (e.g., wait 5-10 seconds after attack)
3. Track the NPC index and wait for it to disappear from nearbyNpcs
4. Use `combatEvents` array to detect damage being dealt

## SDK Feedback

### Combat Status Fields Being Tested

1. **PlayerCombatState** (`player.combat`)
   - `inCombat: boolean` - player has a target
   - `targetIndex: number` - who we're targeting
   - `lastDamageTick: number` - when we last took damage

2. **NearbyNpc combat fields**
   - `hp / maxHp / healthPercent` - NPC health tracking
   - `targetIndex: number` - who the NPC is targeting
   - `inCombat: boolean` - is NPC in combat with anyone

3. **CombatEvent array** (`state.combatEvents`)
   - `type: 'damage_taken' | 'damage_dealt' | 'kill'`
   - `damage: number`
   - `sourceIndex / targetIndex` - who hit who

### Questions Answered
- [x] Is `player.combat.inCombat` reliable? **NO** - returns false even during active combat
- [x] Does `npc.inCombat` correctly indicate when NPCs are fighting? **UNCLEAR** - may have false positives
- [ ] Are combat events being logged correctly? **NEEDS TESTING** - not visible in state snapshots
- [x] Is kill detection working (NPC disappears or HP=0)? **PARTIAL** - NPC disappearance works, but hp/maxHp always 0

## SDK Fixes Applied (by Claude)

**Date**: After Run 001 feedback

### Issues Fixed

1. **`player.combat.inCombat` now reliable** ✅
   - **Root cause**: Only checked `targetId !== -1`, which resets between attack animations
   - **Fix**: Now also checks `combatCycle > loopCycle` (400-tick window after any hit)
   - **Test result**: `player.combat.inCombat: true` during combat (was false before)

2. **`npc.inCombat` improved** ✅
   - Same fix applied - uses `combatCycle` in addition to `targetId`

3. **`npc.hp/maxHp` documented** ✅
   - This is expected behavior - server only sends HP data when NPC takes damage
   - Added JSDoc comments explaining: "NOTE: 0 until NPC takes damage"
   - **Test result**: After first hit, health shows correctly (e.g., 7/7 → 6/7 → 5/7)

4. **`npc.combatCycle` field added** ✅
   - New field exposed for scripts to do custom timing logic
   - Value is `tick + 400` when NPC takes damage

5. **`combatEvents` ARE working** ✅
   - Test showed `damage_dealt` events being tracked
   - Note: Damage value may show 0 for misses/blocks

### Code Changes

- `webclient/src/bot/BotSDK.ts:354-358` - Player `inCombat` fix
- `webclient/src/bot/BotSDK.ts:611-619` - NPC `inCombat` fix
- `agent/types.ts` - Added `combatCycle` field and JSDoc docs

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run combat state test
bun test/combat-state.ts

# Run combat events test (more thorough)
bun test/combat-events.ts
```

### Recommended Script Changes

Your `waitForCombatEnd()` should now work better since `player.combat.inCombat` stays TRUE during combat. However, consider also checking:

```typescript
// More robust combat detection
const isInCombat = (): boolean => {
    const state = sdk.getState();
    const pc = state?.player?.combat;
    if (!pc) return false;

    // inCombat is now reliable (uses combatCycle internally)
    return pc.inCombat;
};

// For NPC-specific checks, use combatCycle directly
const npcRecentlyHit = (npc: NearbyNpc, currentTick: number): boolean => {
    return npc.combatCycle > currentTick;
};
```

**Please test and confirm if these fixes resolve your issues!**

## Run 002 - 2026-01-25 (after SDK fixes)

**Outcome**: TIMEOUT (ran full 5 minutes) - 8+ kills, **17,490 XP gained!**

### Results

| Metric | Run 001 | Run 002 | Improvement |
|--------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Kills | 1 | 8+ | 8x |
| Total XP | ~1600 | 17,490 | 10x |
| Attack | 0→? | +8,800 | Working |
| Strength | 0 | +4,400 | Working |
| Defence | 0 | 0 | (switched style too late) |
| Hitpoints | +390 | +4,290 | 10x |
| Damage dealt | 0 | 20 | Now tracked |
| Damage taken | 0 | 10 | Now tracked |
| Food eaten | 0 | 1 | Working |
| Looted | 0 | 5 | Working |

### SDK Fixes Verified

1. **`player.combat.inCombat` - FIXED** - Stays true during combat now
2. **`npc.combatCycle` - WORKING** - Reliable combat detection via tick comparison
3. **`combatEvents` - WORKING** - Damage tracking functional
4. **Kill detection - WORKING** - NPC disappearance detected correctly

### Script Fixes Applied

1. Fixed `waitForCombatEnd()` to use `combatCycle` comparison
2. Fixed food regex to not match "fishing net" (`/^(bread|shrimps?|...)$/i`)

### Remaining Issues

1. **HP: 0/0 still showing** - Expected behavior (0 until first damage)
2. **"Timeout waiting to attack"** - Pathing issues, need investigation
3. **"already in combat"** - May be competing with other players/NPCs
4. **Defence XP = 0** - Style switching happened too late in the run

### Next Steps

- Start with Defensive style to get Defence XP
- Better NPC selection (avoid ones being fought by others)
- Log HP values after first hit to confirm tracking

## Run 003 - 2026-01-24 (10 minute run with weapon upgrade)

**Setup**: Extended run with phased strategy and weapon upgrade path

### Hypotheses

1. **10 minutes allows for weapon upgrade trip** - Time to farm coins (~140gp), travel to Al Kharid, buy iron scimitar, return
2. **Iron scimitar major DPS boost** - +9 slash attack, +10 strength bonus vs bronze sword's +4/+1 - should significantly increase kill speed
3. **Starting with Defensive style** - Will fix the Defence XP = 0 problem from Run 002
4. **Phased approach**:
   - Phase 1 (farming): Kill goblins with Defensive style, prioritize coin looting
   - Phase 2 (upgrading): Walk to Al Kharid, buy iron scimitar, return
   - Phase 3 (training): Continue with better weapon, cycle styles

### Script Changes

1. **Time extended to 10 minutes** (from 5)
2. **Stall timeout increased to 60s** (from 45s) to accommodate shop trip
3. **Combat style logic**:
   - Phase 1: Always Defensive (for Defence XP)
   - Phase 3: Cycle Def → Atk → Str → Def... every 3 kills
4. **Weapon upgrade system**:
   - Triggers when coins >= 142 (112 scimitar + 10 toll + 20 buffer)
   - Walks to Al Kharid gate (3268, 3227)
   - Handles toll gate dialog
   - Walks to Zeke's Scimitar Shop (3287, 3186)
   - Buys and equips iron scimitar
   - Returns to goblin area
5. **Improved looting**: Prioritizes coins over bones, larger pickup radius (5 tiles)

### Testing

- [ ] Does the phase system work correctly?
- [ ] Can we successfully buy from Al Kharid shop?
- [ ] Does the gate toll dialog handling work?
- [ ] Is Defence XP > 0 now?
- [ ] Is the iron scimitar significantly faster at killing?

### Results

**Outcome**: TIMEOUT (ran full 10 minutes) - 15+ kills before server issues

| Metric | Run 002 | Run 003 (partial) | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------------------|-------|
| Time limit | 5 min | 10 min | Extended |
| Kills | 8+ | 15+ | More time = more kills |
| Total XP | 17,490 | 44,020 | 2.5x improvement |
| Attack | +8,800 | +0 | (Defensive style used) |
| Strength | +4,400 | +33,200 | **BUG: Wrong style!** |
| Defence | 0 | 0 | Style 3 not working |
| Hitpoints | +4,290 | +10,820 | 2.5x |
| Coins collected | ? | 1 | Goblins drop very few |

### Observations

**CRITICAL BUG FOUND**: Combat style switching still not working properly!
- Set `COMBAT_STYLES.DEFENSIVE = 3` (was 2) because swords have 4 styles not 3
- But XP still going to Strength instead of Defence
- Need to verify sword combat style indices in-game

**Weapon upgrade not viable**: Only collected 1 coin in 10 minutes from goblins.
Goblins have poor coin drops - need different funding strategy (maybe sell bones?).

### Fixes Applied After Run 003

1. **Combat style indices corrected for swords**:
   ```typescript
   COMBAT_STYLES = {
       ACCURATE: 0,    // Stab - Attack XP
       AGGRESSIVE: 1,  // Lunge - Strength XP
       CONTROLLED: 2,  // Slash - Shared XP
       DEFENSIVE: 3,   // Block - Defence XP
   }
   ```

2. **Phase transition timeout**: Skip weapon upgrade after 15 kills if insufficient coins

3. **Training phase now uses Controlled style** (index 2) for balanced XP instead of cycling

### Server Issues

After initial run, game server became unresponsive to new logins.
- Multiple Java processes running (potential conflict)
- All tests failing with "Timeout waiting for login"

### Next Steps

- [x] Verify combat style indices work correctly (check in-game) - **FIXED in Run 003b!**
- [ ] Consider alternative funding: sell bones to general store
- [x] Test when server is restored
- [ ] May need to start with coins in preset for testing upgrade path

---

## Run 003b - 2026-01-25 (after combat style fix)

**Setup**: Same as Run 003 but with corrected combat style indices

### Results

**Outcome**: TIMEOUT (ran full 10 minutes) - 6 kills

| Metric | Run 003 | Run 003b | Notes |
|--------|---------|----------|-------|
| Kills | 15+ | 6 | More combat interruptions |
| Total XP | 44,020 | 29,680 | Lower due to fewer kills |
| Attack | +0 | +0 | Correct (using Defensive) |
| Strength | +33,200 | +0 | **FIXED!** |
| Defence | 0 | **+22,400** | **COMBAT STYLE FIX WORKS!** |
| Hitpoints | +10,820 | +7,280 | Proportional to kills |
| Coins | 1 | 2 | Still very few |

### Key Finding: COMBAT STYLE FIX VERIFIED!

**Defence XP is now being gained!** The fix to use style index 3 for Defensive (Block) was correct.

```
Switching to Block (Defence) style
...
XP Gained: Atk +0, Str +0, Def +22400, HP +7280
```

### Issues Observed

1. **Many "lost_target" results** - NPCs disappearing mid-combat
2. **"already in combat" errors** - Other players/NPCs competing for goblins
3. **"Timeout waiting to attack"** - Pathing issues reaching NPCs
4. **Only 6 kills in 10 min** vs 15+ before - need to investigate combat reliability

### Analysis

The combat style system now works correctly:
- Phase 1 (farming): Uses Block (style 3) → Defence XP ✓
- Phase 3 (training): Will use Slash (style 2) → Shared XP

The lower kill count suggests combat tracking/targeting needs improvement, but the core style switching is validated.

---

## Run 004 - 2026-01-25 (improved combat detection)

**Setup**: Added XP-based combat detection for more reliable kill tracking

### Combat Detection Improvements

1. Track XP at start of combat wait
2. Check XP gains during loop - if XP increased, combat is happening
3. Count NPC disappearance as kill if XP was gained
4. Reduced "lost_target" false negatives

### Results

**Outcome**: ERROR (browser disconnected after ~5 minutes)

| Metric | Run 003b | Run 004 | Notes |
|--------|----------|---------|-------|
| Kills counted | 6 | 4 | Still undercounting |
| Defence XP | 22,400 | **14,000** | Great progress! |
| Defence Level | ~20 | **30** | Level 30 in 5 min! |
| Hitpoints XP | 7,280 | 5,704 | Proportional |
| Hitpoints Level | ~15 | **22** | |
| Coins | 0 | 2+ | Picking up coins now |

### Key Findings

1. **Combat style confirmed working** - All XP going to Defence (0 Attack, 0 Strength)
2. **XP-based detection helps** - Combat starts being detected properly
3. **Kill counting still inconsistent** - 4 counted vs ~hundreds actual (based on XP)
4. **Browser stability issues** - Connection keeps dropping mid-run

### Analysis

The 14,000 Defence XP with only 4 "counted" kills suggests we're actually getting many more kills than detected. At ~40 XP per goblin kill (Defence + HP), that's ~350+ actual kills in ~5 minutes.

XP rate: 14,000 + 5,704 = ~19,700 XP in ~5 min = **~237k XP/hour potential!**

### Browser Issues

The puppeteer connection keeps closing unexpectedly:
- "ConnectionClosedError: Connection closed"
- Happens after variable time (5-10 minutes)
- Not related to script logic - infrastructure issue

## Run 005 - 2026-01-25 (Al Kharid Journey!)

**Goal**: Train at Lumbridge until Combat Level 15, then travel to Al Kharid for better training.

### New Strategy

1. **Balanced training** - Cycle combat styles every 2 kills (Attack → Strength → Defence)
2. **Combat level trigger** - Travel to Al Kharid at Combat Level 15
3. **Gate handling** - Sell bones for 10gp toll if needed
4. **Al Kharid training** - Buy kebabs for food, train on warriors/men

### Results

**Outcome**: TIMEOUT (ran full 10 minutes) - Successfully reached Al Kharid!

| Metric | Run 004 | Run 005 | Notes |
|--------|---------|---------|-------|
| Time limit | 5 min | 10 min | Extended |
| Combat Level | 16 | 17 | Similar |
| Kills counted | 4 | 8 | Includes Al Kharid training |
| Location | Lumbridge | **Al Kharid** | **Made it!** |
| Training style | Defence only | Balanced | All 3 melee stats |
| Gate passed | N/A | **Yes** | Toll paid successfully |
| Scimitar bought | N/A | No | Not enough coins (5/112) |
| Kebabs bought | N/A | No | Wrong NPC found (Zeke) |

### What Worked

1. **Gate passage** - Successfully navigated Al Kharid toll gate on attempt 4-5
2. **Combat style cycling** - XP distributed across Attack, Strength, and Defence
3. **Phase transitions** - Lumbridge → Upgrading → Al Kharid worked correctly
4. **Fallback targeting** - When warriors too strong, switched to Men

### Issues Found

1. **Kebab shop location** - Script found Zeke (scimitar shop) instead of Karim
   - Fixed: Updated coordinates to (3273, 3181)

2. **Not enough coins for scimitar** - Only had 5gp after toll (needed 112)
   - Goblins/bones don't provide enough gold for purchases
   - Consider: Start with coins in preset, or raise combat level trigger

3. **Warriors hit hard** - Ran out of food quickly, had to fight Men instead
   - Without kebabs, survival is difficult against level 9 warriors

### XP Distribution Example

From one run:
- Attack: Level 22-26 (6000-8800 XP)
- Strength: Level 1-19 (0-4400 XP)
- Defence: Level 1-13 (0-2000 XP)
- Hitpoints: Level 19-21 (4000-5200 XP)

### Combat Style Rotation

Working correctly:
```
Kill 0-1: Stab (Attack)
Kill 2-3: Lunge (Strength)
Kill 4-5: Block (Defence)
Kill 6-7: Stab (Attack)
...
```

### Next Steps

- [ ] Fix kebab shop NPC detection
- [ ] Consider raising combat level trigger to 20 (more coins/bones)
- [ ] Add coin collection priority over bones
- [ ] Test with preset that includes starting coins
